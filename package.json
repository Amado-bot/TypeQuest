Users will also be able to upvote or comment on each specific test.\r >\r > The user will also be able to pick their own theme from a list of themes, and have that selection saved for when they log in the next time.\r >\r > We would like the typing prompts to be story based, and have each typing prompt have some sort of choice that influences the next prompt to appear, sort of like a \"choose your own adventure\".\r ![Screenshot1](/assets/images/SCREENSHOT1.JPG)\r ![Screenshot2](/assets/images/SCREENSHOT2.JPG)",
