# Just My Type

> We would like to create a typing game website that tracks the user's words per minute and errors, and then saves them to a database to be displayed as statistics to the user's profile.
>
> There will be a high-scores leaderboard for the fastest typers to encourage users to compete against one another to be the best typist.
>
> Users will be able to post comments on eachother's profiles and upvote the comments. Users will also be able to upvote or comment on each specific test.
>
> The user will also be able to pick their own theme from a list of themes, and have that selection saved for when they log in the next time.
>
> We would like the typing prompts to be story based, and have each typing prompt have some sort of choice that influences the next prompt to appear, sort of like a "choose your own adventure".
